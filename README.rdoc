== README

Alpha blog is a very basic and simple Ruby on Rails apps created for me to learn how to code Ruby on Rails.

Things that are on this simple Ruby on Rails app:

* Home page with an image and a link to 'About' page

* About page with a link to go back to the home page


<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
